# Hi there 👋
# Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

I'm **Jerônimo de Rossi Molina**, owner of Urbano Estratégia, a software and consultant company for HNW/UHNW people and, Innovation & Technology Manager at governmental innovative programm InovaRS. 

I work at the intersection of machine learning, artificial intelligence, simulating agents and AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things), developing integrated hardware and software solutions for real-world challenges. My focus is on designing and implementing predictive systems that support decision-making in dynamic environments—whether in urban infrastructure, public management, or industry.

Here, you’ll find a portfolio that bridges data science with applied technology, showcasing projects that range from smart devices to intelligent systems across sectors such as business, agriculture, and public services. This is a practical and interdisciplinary approach to innovation, where algorithms meet action.
