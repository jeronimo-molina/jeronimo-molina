# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

I'm **JerÃ´nimo de Rossi Molina**, a data scientist and currently a PhD candidate in History at the University of Passo Fundo (Brazil), researching in the fields of International Politics and Geopolitics. My projects and academic research focus on predicting the behavior of agents (people, countries, weather, and even animals) acting in social, geographic, or political environments. Here, you can find research spanning from Business to Social Sciences; from Political Science to Agriculture; from Conceptual History to Computer Science. This is an interdisciplinary scientific approach, merging data science with various fields and databases.
