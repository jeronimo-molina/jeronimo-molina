# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

I'm **JerÃ´nimo de Rossi Molina**, CEO at Urbano Applied Research and Innovation & Technology Manager at InovaRS. I work at the intersection of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things), developing integrated hardware and software solutions for real-world challenges. My focus is on designing and implementing predictive systems that support decision-making in dynamic environmentsâ€”whether in urban infrastructure, public management, or industry.

Here, youâ€™ll find a portfolio that bridges data science with applied technology, showcasing projects that range from smart devices to intelligent systems across sectors such as business, agriculture, and public services. This is a practical and interdisciplinary approach to innovation, where algorithms meet action.
